## Notes

[Transcript](https://botbot.me/freenode/dojo-meeting/2016-01-12/?msg=57783689&page=1)

* *Dylan* - Closed 12 more tickets for Dojo 1.11, [outstanding tickets](https://bugs.dojotoolkit.org/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=reopened&milestone=1.11&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=component&col=changetime&report=186&order=owner)
* *Dylan* - Rawld still wants to help with some of them, which is a current blocker
* *Dylan* - Still struggling to get tests to run on Intern without issues
* *Dylan* - Some tests failing, mostly NodeList-fx
* *Kit* - Still optimisitic of end of month release?
* *Dylan* - If we can get the updates to Closure from Rawld, we could punt, but that is sad because it makes the build slow
* *Dylan* - If anyone has time, I could use the help on Dojo 1.11
* *Kit* - Ok, next up [dojo/typings](https://github.com/dojo/typings)
* *Kit* - It should help people developing with Dojo in TypeScript, but can also help if doing JavaScript in something like [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* *Kit* - More accurate than DefinitelyTyped
* *Kit* - Hopefully we can get more contributions from the community
* *Kit* - Status of Dojo2 next...
* *Kit* - Some feedback on dojo/actions
* *Kit* - Neil, you are working on the Application Factory?
* *Neil* - Yes, but I have gotten to the point where I need a clearer application architecture
* *Kit* - Ok, it is being worked on, being reviewed by a couple people as well as I am working on a prototype of widgets so that we can then string an application together
* *Kit* - Bryan had some exposure to [Observables](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS) and [ImmutableJS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) and suggested they shoud be part of Dojo 2.  I agree.
* *Kit* - Observables are being put forward as a TC39 proposal and have sufficient support to get accepted
* *Kit* - ImmutableJS is straight forward and makes sense for immutable collections.
* *Kit* - Should be able to integrate them easily into Dojo 2 packages/applications
* *Kit* - Somehow we introduced a serious regression into the dojo/loader, we need to find out how and ensure we test so that doesn't happen again
* *Kit* - AOB? Nope? Ok, close...
